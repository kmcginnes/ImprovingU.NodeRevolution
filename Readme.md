# Node Revolution

This class will not be about the language or handling web requests or making database calls. This class will be about what makes Node special. We'll discover how a single product is revolutionizing the software world and permeating every facet of our development experience.

Most popular languages can be used in many ways: server app, desktop app, console app, build script, REPL, etc. What makes Node different is that it can do one thing the others can't: run in the browser. This is not one more bullet on the feature list, this is a revolution. Let's discover why, together.
