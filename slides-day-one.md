# Node Revolution

## Agenda

* What is Node
* When is Node
* Why to Node
* How to Node

---

## What is Node.js

---

## What is Node.js

* Google's V8 JavaScript engine
* Event driven
* Non-blocking standard libraries
* Most APIs speak Streams
* Extensible via C/C++ add-ons
* Provides a package manager and module system for JS/native extensions
* EcmaScript 5 (Node v0.12.*) & EcmaScript 6 (Node 4.*)
* JIT & optimized JavaScript

---

## What is Node.js

> Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

---

## What is Node.js

It's important to remember that Node is really two things: a runtime environment and a set of libraries. Like .Net is the CLR and the base class libraries. The Node libraries have first class support for things like HTTP requests and non-blocking IO calls.

---

## What Node.js is not

* A framework like Asp.net MVC/Web Forms
* A new programming language

---

## History

* 1996 JavaScript released by Netscape
* 1999 Ajax introduced in Internet Explorer 5
* 2006 jQuery is released
* 2008 Google releases V8 JavaScript engine
* 2009 Ryan Dahl starts Node.js
* 2011 NPM introduced
* 2014 Node.js forked and IO.js created
* 2015 EcmaScript 6 finalized
* 2015 IO.js merges back into Node.js

---

## Why Node.js

---

## JavaScript everywhere

* Code reuse
* Same programming culture on client and server
* Lots of JavaScript programmers

---

## Vibrant community

* 190,000+ packages on npm
* Top corporate sponsers
* Huge wealth of JavaScript code

---

## Sweet spots

* Real-time/high concurrency apps (I/O bound)
* API tier for single page apps and rich clients (iOS/Android)
* Service orchestration
* Working with document (JSON-style) databases

---

## Not so sweet spots

* Simple CRUD apps (lack of frameworks)
* Not as fast as some for CPU-intensive stuff

---

## How to Node

## Standard libraries

* Async by default
* Low level
* HTTP is first class citizen

---

## Demo

```javascript
var http = require('http');

var server = http.createServer(function(request, response) {
    response.writeHead(200, {
        'Content-Type': 'text/plain'
    });
    response.end('Hello world');
});

server.listen(3000);

console.log("Server listening on http://localhost:3000");
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

## Developing and Debugging

* Lots of different choices
* [nodemon](http://nodemon.io) for save, refresh browser workflow
* [node-inspector](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector) allows debugging in Chrome
* IDEs (WebStorm, Eclipse, Visual Studio [Code], etc)

---

## Demo

`> npm install -g node-inspector`

`> node-debug app.js`

Open in Chrome [http://localhost]()

---

## CommonJS modules

* Prevents pollution of the global scope
* Two style of module development

---

### Demo

Create a simple logger module and import it into our app.

__logger.js__

```javascript
exports.info = function(msg) {
    console.log(new Date() + ': ' + msg);
};

exports.error = function(msg) {
    console.error(new Date() + ': ' + msg);
};
```

Then modify `app.js`:

```javascript
var logger = require('./logger');

logger.info('Logging hello world');
```

---

## Demo

When you want to export a instance factory you must use `module.exports`.

__point.js__

```javascript
function Point(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
}

Point.prototype.print = function() {
    console.log(this.x + ', ' + this.y);
}

module.exports = Point;
```

__app.js__

```javascript
var Point = require('./Point');

var point = new Point(25, 36);

point.print();
```

---

## Async callbacks and error handling

* Any async function allows you to pass a callback
* Callback parameters include an `Error` parameter
* Errors will bring down the process if not handled

---

### Demo

__app.js__

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('/', function (err) {
    if(err) throw err;

    console.log('completed');
});
```

---

## What is NPM

NPM is a command line utility that allows the installation and management of Node modules. These modules can be installed from many sources, but the most common one is [npmjs.com](http://www.npmjs.com).

NPM can install modules into your application, or globally into the system itself.

Every Node application is a module by default.

---

## What is NPM

* Node standard libraries are 
* `require('http')` looks on the global Node module path
* NPM installs packags to a local `node_modules` folder and adds that to the Node module path
* `require('express')` will be found in the local `node_modules` folder
