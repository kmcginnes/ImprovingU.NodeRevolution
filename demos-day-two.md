# Demos: Day Two

## Start with server side React web site

Let's create a simple web server which serves up html generated on the server by React. In order to do this we'll set up the following:

1. The server bootstrap code
2. The hello world index page
3. The gulp file to compile JSX code (with Webpack)
4. The unit tests to verify our DOM
5. The test runner (Karma)
6. The router to let us add more pages

With the nodemon server, gulp, and unit tests running all the time, now is the perfect moment to introduce an alternative console that has 4 pane window.
